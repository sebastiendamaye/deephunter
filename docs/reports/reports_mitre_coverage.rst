###############################

This report shows your current MITRE coverage (provided threat hunting analytics are correctly mapped in DeepHunter).

Unmapped techniques appear in grey and mapped ones appear in green. All boxes are links that point to techniques on the MITRE website.

Alternatively, you can export this mapping to be used in the `MITRE ATT&CK Navigator <https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/>`_. To do that, save a local copy of the ``mitre.json`` file (right click on the link as save as a local file), and upload it to the ATT&CK Navigator.

You can easily list threat hunting analytics that are missing a MITRE mapping by using `this report <reports_missing_mitre.html>`_.
