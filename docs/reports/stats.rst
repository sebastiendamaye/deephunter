There are 3 graphs:

- Evolution of the number of analytics
- Campaigns duration (in minutes). You may want to check the `Threat Hunting Analytics performance report <perfs.html>`_ for more details.
- Total number of endpoints matched for each campaign

Notice that the graphs rely on the database retention specified in the `DB_DATA_RETENTION <../settings.html#db-data-retention>`_ setting.
