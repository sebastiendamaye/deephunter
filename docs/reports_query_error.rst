Reports: Threat Hunting Analytics with errors
#############################################

This report shows the list of Threat Hunting Analytics that triggered messages (e.g. errors, recommendations, etc.) during a campaign or a statistics regeneration process. Both the error flag and the error message will be automatically removed at the next campaign (if the analytic's run_daily flag has not been automatically unset), or when the threat hunting analytic's query field will be updated.
